Working on Windows OS
=====================

The primary development and delivery platforms for this tool are OSX and Linux. 
At present, the tools work on Microsoft Windows with the addition of the
``--rootless`` command line argument. For example, the ``run`` command on Windows
would look like this:

.. code-block::

   4dgb-workflow --rootless run 4DGB_Project 

This same option can be included in other examples shown in this documentation,
and the tool will work as expected.
