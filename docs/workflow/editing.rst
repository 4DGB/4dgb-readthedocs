Editing a template with your data
=================================

After you've created a template using the ``4dgbworkflow`` tool, you 
can edit that template to create a project using your own data.

The ``project.yaml`` file has several sections:

- workflow
- project
- datasets
- tracks
- bookmarks
- annotations
